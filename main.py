# Wrap a neural network model with Flask
# what you will do?
# - get an image as an input
# - run a neural network on it
# - return the results
# - wrap the app with docker with all relevant environment variables
#   the production start script should be named "serve"
# - except a /predict API call, add also /health API
# - eventually we want to call `docker run -p 8080:8080 image_name serve` and it will run the server

# things to take into consideration:
# logging
# virtualenv
# project folder structure
# use python3.6
